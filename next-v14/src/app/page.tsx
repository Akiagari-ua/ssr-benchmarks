Each step sent a gentle ripple through the fallen leaves, their rustling echoing softly through the trees. Above, the sunlight filtered through the branches, painting patterns of gold and green across the forest floor. The figure paused, as if listening to some hidden melody in the breeze. Somewhere in the distance, a bird called out, breaking the tranquil silence. And just like that, the figure was gone, disappearing into the depths of the woods, leaving only the whisper of leaves in their wake.' />
